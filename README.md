# About
PhD economist from ["Washington State University"] (https://ses.wsu.edu/) with expertise in the fields of econometrics and industrial organization, and more than 10 years of experience across consulting, industry, academia, and government. 

During my doctoral studies in economics and my MS in statistics, and in the years since, I have focused my research on applied econometrics and statistical methods, making contributions to new econometric methods and applications in various areas such as labor and health economics.

In recent years, I have conducted applied economic research on economic consulting related to litigation in healthcare and pharmaceutical matters. My work has involved employing methods for causal inference and modeling techniques to estimate counterfactual predictions.
