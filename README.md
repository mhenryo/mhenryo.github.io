# About
I am a PhD economist from [Washington State University's School of Economic Sciences](https://ses.wsu.edu/), specializing in econometrics and industrial organization. With over 10 years of experience spanning consulting, industry, academia, and government sectors, I bring a comprehensive background to my work.

My dissertation involved various econometric analyses of choice behavior of consumers and households facing discrete and dynamic choice processes, respectively. For example, it provided the first empirical application of an innovative [semi-parametric binary response estimator](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wre.2017.10.006), which I applied to estimate the willingness to pay for recreation demand using a stated-preference contingent valuation survey dataset. 

In recent years, I have conducted applied economic research on economic consulting related to litigation in healthcare and pharmaceutical matters. My work has involved employing methods for causal inference and modeling techniques to estimate counterfactual predictions.
