# About
I am a PhD economist from [Washington State University's School of Economic Sciences](https://ses.wsu.edu/), specializing in econometrics and industrial organization. With over 10 years of experience spanning consulting, industry, academia, and government sectors, I bring a comprehensive background to my work.

During my doctoral studies in economics and my MS in statistics, and in the years since, I have focused my research on applied econometrics and statistical methods, making contributions to new econometric methods and applications in various areas such as labor and health economics.

In recent years, I have conducted applied economic research on economic consulting related to litigation in healthcare and pharmaceutical matters. My work has involved employing methods for causal inference and modeling techniques to estimate counterfactual predictions.
