# About
I am a PhD economist from [Washington State University's School of Economic Sciences](https://ses.wsu.edu/), specializing in econometrics and industrial organization. With over 10 years of experience spanning consulting, industry, academia, and government sectors, I bring a comprehensive background to my work.

My research has focused on applied econometrics and statistical methods, making contributions to new econometric methods and applications in various areas such as resource, food, labor, and health economics. 

My dissertation involved various econometric analyses of choice behavior of consumers and households facing discrete and dynamic choice processes, respectively. For example, it provided the first empirical application of an innovative [semi-parametric binary response estimator](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wre.2017.10.006), which I applied to estimate the willingness to pay for recreation demand using a stated-preference contingent valuation survey dataset. 

During an internship at the [USDA's Economic Research Service (ERS), Branch of Diet, Health and Safety](https://www.ers.usda.gov/), I help enhance the analytical usefulness of Nielsen Homescan panel data -- a nationwide longitudinal database on food purchase transactions of U.S. households. Using this panel dataset, I examined household purchase dynamics for dietary fiber using a dynamic Tobit model that accounts for the effect of past purchases on current fiber purchase decisions. For more details see [here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3106101).

In recent years, I have conducted applied economic research on economic consulting related to litigation in healthcare and pharmaceutical matters. My work has involved employing methods for causal inference and modeling techniques to estimate counterfactual predictions.
